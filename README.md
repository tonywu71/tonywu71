### Hi, I'm Tony 👋🏼

I'm a Research Engineer based in Paris. I grew up in a small town near Disneyland Paris 🇫🇷, and I'm lucky to have traveled around the world during my academic years (love you 🇧🇷🇭🇰🇬🇧).

- 💼 I'm currently working at ILLUIN Technology where I specialize in RAG and Document AI.
- 😍 Among my past and current hobbies: guitar, rowing (erg is no fun), gym, and cinema.
- 🔬 Research interests: LLM, Multimodal, Speech, Agents.

💬 Feel free to reach out to discuss research ideas!
