### Hi, I'm Tony 👋🏼

I'm a DataScientist/ML researcher. I grew up in a small town near Disneyland Paris 🇫🇷 (pretty cool eh?), and I'm lucky to have traveled around the world during my academic years (love you 🇧🇷🇭🇰🇬🇧).

- 🎓 I studied a MEng CentraleSupélec in Paris-Saclay. I also finished the MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence (MLMI) at the University of Cambridge (Sidney Sussex College).
- 💼 I'm currently working at ILLUIN Technology. I'm doing both R&D and ML development, and I specialize in RAG and Document AI.
- 😍 Among my past and current hobbies: guitar, rowing (erg is no fun), gym, cinema, and animation.
- 💬 Fun fact: My favorite English idiom is *Let's get this bread*, which sounds absurdly funny for a French guy.
